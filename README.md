# ECGsynchronizer

Source code developed to build a simple prospective ECG-T synchronizer that generates a Transistor-Transistor-Logic (TTL) signal to be used in any TTL compatible instrument.  The system is based in an Arduino-based controller board and can be adjusted to trigger events at any phase of the cardiac cycle, or to compensate for possible instrumentation delays.
